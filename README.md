# Bootstrap Responsive Website

## Purpose
The Summer Bell Company is in charge of organizing the next music festival event for 2025, which will feature world-class artists such as Dua Lipa, 
Adele, and Avril Lavigne. The event will host more than 19,000 people for 7 days, during which they will experience live music and special effects on stage, 
creating a unique experience.

## Description
The website is divided into: nav, header, main, and footer.

- Nav: Includes the logo and buttons for navigating to other pages.
  
The nav bar features a drop-down menu, which is adaptable for mobile devices. The header displays a carousel of images promoting the stellar performances, 
providing details like artist names, dates, times, and venues.

- Header: Features an image gallery carousel showcasing stellar performances, with details such as artist names, dates, times, and locations.
  
- Main: Divided into sections for text, location, lineup, and more information.
A text section explains the significance of the event, followed by details about the event's location, including the place name, address, and a photo.

The lineup section presents artist cards with names, descriptions, and a "Book Ticket" button. A Bootstrap modal allows users to select ticket types (General, 
VIP, Meet & Greet, and Platinum) and includes a text field for email registration.

The "More Information" section is divided into three subsections: Help and Information, Booking a Hotel, and Merch.

- Footer: Contains links to social networks and copyright text.

## Design Choices
The event is aimed at young people and adults between 20 and 40 years old. Only the color crimson, combined with black and lead, was used because the website 
contains many images and could cause visual fatigue for the user. The Anton font was chosen because it is bold and impactful. The background is white to minimize 
distractions and allow the user to focus on the website's content.
